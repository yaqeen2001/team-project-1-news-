            <p>
                Koruna continues to spread in Hong Kong, which is experiencing a second wave more intense than the first (and some claim it is a third wave) yesterday, 145 new patients were recorded, the highest number recorded since the outbreak of the epidemic. Hong Kong will not accept a loss of control over the situation, as has happened in many other countries, and has begun imposing new restrictions starting on Wednesday for a week. Among these restrictions are: Banning food in restaurants, gathering more than two people together, and imposing masks among people. This is the first time that Hong Kong has forbidden to eat in restaurants since the outbreak, and this is expected to cause a problem for many people who have no kitchens in their small apartments and cannot cook. Hong Kong has reached 2,779 injured so far, only 1,500 from July.

                Vietnam is also worried about a third wave of illness. Once they learned about the epidemic in China, the land borders between the two countries were closed in Vietnam, and they operated emergency plans, thus eliminating the first and second waves that befell them without casualties. They still report some injuries, from time to time, but most come from outside the country. The country recently entered a state of heightened alert after its first local diagnosis was diagnosed from April to today. After diagnosing three other patients in the tourist city of Da Nang, they began evacuating about 80,000 tourists, most of whom were local residents, for quarantine and the imposition of social divergence laws. Meanwhile, the police there began taking measures against illegal immigration from China, which the authorities claim leads to an increase in the number of cases. So far, Vietnam has counted 427 people with coronas.

                In Mexico, which are among the countries most affected by the disease to date, 390,516 cases have been diagnosed so far, an increase of 5,480 people from yesterday, and the number of reported deaths rose to 43,680 after the death of 306 others. Among the many deaths, the Minister of Health of one of the provinces of Mexico died, about two weeks after his hospitalization as a result of the disease. Mexico ranks fourth in the number of corona deaths.
